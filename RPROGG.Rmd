##Writing Code/Setting Your Working Directory
* Getting working directory
*getwd () ###Shows what is current working directory
###Why knowing working directory is important?
*R reads and write files from your working directory
*To check files in your working directory type 
*dir () 
###advice  is to create a folder for the course and keep it as working directory
*Use command ls () to know which are files/functions/data frame loaded into current working session of R
### Loading functions/codes saved in.R extension file
* Type source ("SOURCE FILE NAME")

##Overview and History of R
*R is a implementation of S language
*S is developed by John Chambers and others at Bell Labs originally implemented as Fortran libraries
*In 1988, system was written in C language
*Version four released in 1998 and it is used currently
*Bell labs>StatSci>Insightful Corporation (Product:S-PLUS>Acquired by TOBCO)>Lucent>Alcatel-Lucent
*Basic behind S language is to enter an interactive environment  where we can write code and view the results
* system helps to transition from user to programmer
* R is created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman from New Zealand licensed in 1993 
*1996 two mailing list developed - R-help and R-devel
*1997 R core group was formed; syntax is similar to S+
###Stack overflow where questions can be answered 
###Free software
*Freedom to run the program (Freedom 0)
*Freedom to source code (Freedom 1)
*Freedom to redistribute copies (Freedom 2)
*Freedom to release changes (Freedom 3)
###Drawbacks
*40 year old technology
*No 3-D graphics
*No corporation for changes/complaints; If needed, build yourself
*Objects needs to be stored on physical memory
*Not ideal for all situations
###Conceptual 1) CRAN (Comprehensive R Archived Network) 2) everything else
*base system contains utils,stats,datasets,graphics,grdevices,grid,methods,tools,parallel,compiler,splines,tcltk,stats4
*commonly used packages boot for bootstrap, class for *classification,cluster,codetools,foreign,KernSmooth,lattice,mgcv,nlme,rpart,survival,MASS,spatial,nnet,matirx
###Packages in CRAN has to pass certain tests, has good documentation on functions,
###References
*Writing R Extensions if interested in writing packages
*R Data Import/Export for importing data into R
*R internals for technical understanding of R/How R implemented at very low level
* Look for book in R by John Chambers, Springer has a series of books Use R!

##Getting Help
*Emailing is crucial, follow certain etiquettes .
*Web, Manual, FAQ, Inspection or experimentation, talking to skilled friend, if programmer-read source code
*Do your home work and start exploring in emails.
*google is your friend, search with error message. Look for appropriate answer.
* is it reproducible (provide examples), Expected output, What are you seeing unexpected results, Version of R/Packages/OS, additional info
###For Email: Phrase smart subject line; <R version><what function/packages><Operating system><What is the problem> 
*<Describe goal><Be explicit><provide minimum amount of information necessary><Be humble><Follow up with solution if found>
###Please do not say found bug, Asking homework questions, Do not send to multiple mailing list, do not ask to debug your code without full information
###For Project specific questions: r-help@r-project.org

##R Console and Input and Evaluation
* `<-` = assignment operator
* x'<-'1 is 'r expression' also 'r object'  with 'numeric factor' associated with it
*x prints value of x through auto-printing
*print (x) is explicit printing
*y'<- is incomplete expression
*'#' indicates comment anything to the right of it will not execute
*msg'<-' "hello" is a character vector with string associated with it
*[1] x is a vector and 1 is the first element
*x'<-'1:20 x is a vector with numeric elements from 1 to 20

$\pagebreak$

##Data Types-R Objects and Attributes
*All the things we manipulate in R is called objects
###5 basic automic  classes
*character
*numeric (real numbers)
*integer
*complex
*logical (True/False)
*'Vector' is most basic object in R and it can contain multiple copies of,
* a single type of objects Vector of characters, vector of integers
*Warning: Can not have mixed type of objects e.g integers and characters in same vector
*'List' can have objects of different class (Exception to Vector)
*Use 'vector function' to create empty vector
*vector has two arguments (<class of the vector>,<length of the vector>) e.g  z<-vector("numeric" ,length=10)
*'Numbers' are important objects in R if you want a numeric class to be changed to integer enter 1 with L
*'inf' stands for infinity it is special number
*'NAN' or 'Nan' represents undefined value/not a number or missing value
*'Attributes' Not every object in R necessarily has attributes. Attributes can be part of an Object
*Common attributes are names,dim names,or,dimension names,mode,class,length
*'Class' of a object, every object will have class and every object has length
*We have an option to add/modify attributes of the objects.

##Data Types-Vectors and Lists
*"c' function used to create vectors of objects c=concatenate things together
*x'<-'c(0.5,0.6) a x numeric vector with two objects ,length two, first element is 0.5 and second element is 0.6 is created
*similarly logical, character, integer and complex vectors can be created in r using 'c' function
*'Vector' function can be used to create vectors with different class and length. x'<-'vector("class", length=)
*When different kinds of objects are mixed in a vector, vector is created with 'least common denominator' there is no error message
*Need to be aware of 'coercion' for mixed objects in a vector and resulting class.
*When different objects are mixed in a vector, coercion occurs so that every element in the vector is of the same class:
*c(1,"a") ## 'character' because least common denominator is character
*c(TRUE,2) ## 'numeric' because R recognizes TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0
*c("a",TRUE) ## character because second element is considered as string
*Objects can be 'explicitly coerced' from one class to another using the as.* functions
*x<-1:5 # class(x) # "integer" 
###as.numeric(x) 1 2 3 4 5
###as.logical(x) TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
###as.character(x) "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" 
###as.complex(x)  1+0i 2+0i 3+0i 4+0i 5+0i
*Nonsensical coercion results in Nas
*x<-c("a","b","c") 
### as.numeric(x)  NA NA NA because Warning message: NAs introduced by coercion  and as.logical(x) NA NA NA 
###List is vector with different class of objects. These are very handy for further analysis (functions)
*x'<-'list(1,"a",TRUE,1+4i) list with different class of elements. It dose not auto print as vector, Elements are indexed by double brackets [[]]
*whereas, elements of vector are indexed by single bracket []

##Data Types-Matrices
* Matrices are vectors with a dimension attribute. 
*Matrices are constructed 'column wise' . First column gets filled and based on maximum number of rows, second column gets filled.
*Can also create matrix by creating 'dimension attribute' on a vector. It is by using the command dim(R object)<-c(nrow=,ncol=)
*column binding and row-binding to create vectors by joining two vectors  <cbind(vector1,vector2) <rbind(vector1,vector2)

$\pagebreak$

##Data Types-Factors
*Factor is special type of vector to represent categorical data. Factors may be Ordered or Unordered.
*Factor as an integer/categorical/logical vector where each integer has a label.
*Factors are treated specially by modeling functions 
*Factors created using factor function and input is a character vector ('Important') <-factor(c(" "," "," ",,,,," ")
*Factors will have levels, We can call table () which will give frequency count of how many of each level are there
*unclass () function strips out the class for a vector
*Order of levels can be set using levels argument in factors to understand baseline level: Need to tell explicitly tell r
*Syntax<-factor(c("","","","",….""),levels=c("first level","second level") levels: first, second if not defined, assigned by system based on alphabetical order

$\pagebreak$

##Data Types-Missing Values
*Special types of objects:
* is.na() used to test object if they are NA
*is.nan() used to test for undefined mathematical operations
*NA values will have class too.
###NAN value can be NA value, but NA value is not necessarily an NAN value
*When we run is.na() or is.nan() r expression, the results displayed as logical values.

$\pagebreak$

##Data Types-Data Frames
*To store tabular data
###Data frames are special type of list where every element of that list has the same length
*Every column should be of same length, no need to have same data type in column
*Can store objects of different classes
*Data frames has special attributes-row name; useful for annotating the data
*Can be created by calling read.table/read.csv
*Can create matrix from Data frame using function<-data.matrix() 'Warning':Object types should be same
*x<-data.frame(column1 name=c(),columnname2=c()) check number of rows and columns suing nrow() and  ncol() respectively 

$\pagebreak$

##Data Types-The names Attribute
*R objects can also have names, useful for writing readable code and self describing objects
*Elements can have names x<-c(1:3) names(x)<-("","","')
*List also can have names.<-list(a=1,b=2,c=3)
*Matrix also can have names these are called 'dim names'  using list function
*dimnames()<-list(c(row names "",""),c(column names"",""))
