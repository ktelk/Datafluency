## Basic Command line Commands
###pwd: For discovering the current directory
*$ pwd
*ls: Show the directory content (cmd-dir rest ls)
*$ ls

###cd: Changing your current directory
*$ cd <path>
*$ cd /Users/Rumil/Downloads (Absolute path)
*$ cd Downloads (Relative path)
*$ cd ~/Downloads (It will take to the right path where ever you are in folder)
*Caution: to visualize only, do not use in scripts (use absolute path only)

###mkdir: Creating directories
*mkdir

###cp : Copying files
*If you want to copy a file into another location type:
*$ cp origin_path destination_path

*If you want to copy a folder into another location type:
*$ cp -r origin_path destination_path
*$ cp -r -f origin_path destination_path (Forcefully… even if no permission)

###mv : Moving files
*Works the same as ‘cp’ but deletes the original file once the new copy is made.
*$ mv origin_path destination_path

###An additional feature is that it works for renaming a file. For instance if in my working directory I have a file called example.txt I want to rename to example2.txt:
*$ mv example.txt example2.txt

###rm: Removing files
*The command that will let us to remove a directory and all its content is
*rm -rf
*-r tells to rm that we want to delete the given directory and all of its contents.
*-f tells to rm that delete the content without prompting for confirmation.

###However be careful by using this command because it can’t be undone.
