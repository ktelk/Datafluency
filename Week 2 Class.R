#The unidimensional condition may be one of TRUE or FALSE, T or F, 1 or 0 or a statement 
#using the truth operators:
#x == y "x is equal to y"
#x != y "x is not equal to y"
#x > y "x is greater than y"
#x < y "x is less than y"
#x <= y "x is less than or equal to y"

#And may combine these using the & or && operators for AND. | or || are the operators for OR.
